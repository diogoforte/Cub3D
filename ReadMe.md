# cub_3d

**cub_3d** is a project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, aimed at creating a basic raycasting engine reminiscent of the classic game Wolfenstein 3D.

## Introduction

In this project, you will find the source code for a simple raycasting engine implemented in C. The engine utilizes the principles of raycasting to render a 3D perspective from a 2D map. This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of raycasting, graphics programming, and optimization techniques.

## Features

- Raycasting engine rendering a 3D perspective
- Texture mapping
- Player movement and collision detection
- Minimap display
- Configurable map layout using a simple file format

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- GNU Make

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cub_3d.git
